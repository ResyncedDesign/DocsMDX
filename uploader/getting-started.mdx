## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Go Uploader Template locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
    
    Download the template from GitHub to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ResyncedDesign/UploaderTemplate.git
    cd UploaderTemplate
    ```

### 2. Configure the Environment

    The template uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive settings.
    1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
        
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    2. Fill out the `.env` with your Cloudflare creditentials

### 3. Start the Application

    Run the application locally to test your setup:
        
    ```bash
    go run src/main.go
    ```

Youâ€™ll see the server start successfully, indicating the app is live. By default, it will run on http://localhost:your-port.
Test it using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

### 4. Deploy to Your Server

Once everything works locally, you can deploy the uploader to your server.
Refer to the <a href="/uploader/deploy">Deployment Guide</a> for detailed instructions on VPS configuration and hosting.

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps

Now that your Go Uploader Template is running, you can:

    1. Customize it to suit your needs (e.g., add authentication, logging, etc.).
    2. Use it with your favorite frontend frameworks to integrate seamless file uploads.
    3. Explore advanced setups, including reverse proxies and HTTPS configurations.
