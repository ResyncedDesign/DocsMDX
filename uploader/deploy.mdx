## ðŸš€ Prerequisites

Before deploying the Go Uploader Template to production, ensure you have the following ready:

- A **Cloudflare Account** with a configured **R2 bucket**.
- A **domain name** managed in Cloudflare.
- A **VPS** or server to host the uploader (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, or any hosting provider) with root or sudo access.
- **Go** (version 1.23 or higher) installed on your vps/server You can install it using:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install golang
    ```

- **HTTP server** like Nginx or Apache for reverse proxy and domain handling.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

    Download the template from GitHub to your server:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ResyncedDesign/UploaderTemplate.git
    cd UploaderTemplate
    ```

### 2. Configure the Environment

    The template uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive settings.
    1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env:
        
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    2. Fill out the `.env` with your Cloudflare creditentials and other settings.

### 3. Test the Application

    Run the application to ensure it works as expected and there are no errors:
        
    ```bash
    go run src/main.go
    ```

    If everything is working as expected, you can proceed to the next step.

### 4. Build the Application
    
    Build the application to create a binary file that can be run on your server:
        
    ```bash
    go build -o resynced-uploader src/main.go
    ```

### 5. Set up Systemd

    Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is used to manage services and daemons. You can create a systemd service file to manage your Go Uploader Template.

    1. Create a new service file:
        
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/resynced-uploader.service
        ```

    2. Add the following configuration to the file:
        
        ```ini
        [Unit]
        Description=Resynced Uploader Service
        After=network.target

        [Service]
        ExecStart=/path/to/project/resynced-uploader
        WorkingDirectory=/path/to/project/
        Restart=always
        User=your-username

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
        ``` 

    3. Save and close the file.

    4. Start and enable the service: 

        ```bash
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl start resynced-uploader
        sudo systemctl enable resynced-uploader
        ```

    5. Check the status of the service to ensure it is running without any errors:

        ```bash
        sudo systemctl status resynced-uploader
        ```

    If everything is working as expected, you can proceed to the next step.

### 6. Set Up a Reverse Proxy

    - Install and configure **Nginx** or **Apache** to route traffic to your GoFiber app.
    - Example for Nginx:
            
            ```nginx
                server {
                    listen 80;
                    server_name yourdomain.com;

                    location / {
                        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:<your-app-port>;
                        proxy_http_version 1.1;
                        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                        proxy_set_header Host $host;
                        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
                    }
                }
            ```

    - Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain and `<your-app-port>` with the port your GoFiber app is running on.
    - Restart Nginx to apply the changes.

        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart nginx
        ```

    If everything is working as expected, you can proceed to the next step.

### 7. Enable HTTPS (Optional but Recommended)

    - Use **Certbot** to install an SSL certificate for your domain: 
    
            ```bash
            sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
            sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
            ```

    - Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the SSL certificate.
    - Restart Nginx to apply the changes.

        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart nginx
        ```
    
    Your Go Uploader Template should now be live and accessible via your domain name. You can test the uploader by uploading a file and verifying that it is stored in your Cloudflare R2 bucket.
