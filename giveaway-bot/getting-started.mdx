# Getting Started

To set up your **Discord.js Giveaway Bot**, follow these steps:
## 1. Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ResyncedDesign/DiscordGiveawayBot.git
   cd DiscordGiveawayBot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your **Bot Token** and **Client ID**:
   ```bash
   BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
   CLIENT_ID=YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
   ```
   You can get the Bot Token and Client ID from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

4. Build the bot to be able to run it properly.
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 2. Invite the Bot to Your Server

To invite your bot to a Discord server, use the following OAuth2 URL:

```plaintext
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with the actual Client ID of your bot.

1. Open the URL in your browser.
2. Select your server and click **Authorize**.

The bot should now be added to your server!

## 3. Configuring the Bot

Once the bot is in your server, you can configure its settings using the provided slash commands:

### `/gsetting`
Use this command to change the giveaway embed color and emoji.

- Example:
   ```
   /gsetting color #ff5733 emoji ðŸŽ‰
   ```
   This sets the embed color to `#ff5733` and the emoji to ðŸŽ‰.

### `/gcreate`
Use this command to create a giveaway.

- Syntax:
   ```
   /gcreate time numberofwinners prize
   ```
- Example:
   ```
   /gcreate 1h 2 Nitro Subscription
   ```
   This creates a giveaway lasting **1 hour** with **2 winners** for a **Nitro Subscription**.

## 4. Running the Bot

Start the bot with the following command:
```bash
npm run start
```

The bot should now be online and ready to manage giveaways in your server!
